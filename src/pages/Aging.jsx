      <h1>Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services
        (DAABHS)! We are dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for
        Arkansans through comprehensive support and services tailored to two
        vital populations: those in need of behavioral health services,
        including mental health and substance abuse treatment, and adults with
        physical disabilities and aging individuals requiring assistance to
        thrive in their homes and communities.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At DAABHS, our mission is clear: to empower individuals and families by

        independence. Through innovative programs and dedicated personnel, we
        strive to create a supportive environment where every Arkansan can
        flourish.
