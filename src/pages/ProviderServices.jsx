          engagement fosters a culture of accountability and excellence that is
          vital for improving service quality.

        <h3 className="dark">2. Comprehensive Quality Assurance Oversight</h3>
        <p>
          With EDORA, quality assurance is taken to the next level. The platform
          equips DPSQA with powerful analytics and reporting tools that allow

          EDORA simplifies the process of investigating complaints within
          long-term care facilities, ensuring that allegations of abuse,
          neglect, and exploitation are addressed swiftly and effectively. By

          EDORA enhances service delivery by streamlining the options counseling
          process for nursing facility clients seeking to transition to less
          restrictive settings. By providing a comprehensive view of available
          resources and services, EDORA empowers clients and their families to

        <p>
          The regulatory landscape for long-term care facilities is complex and
          ever-changing. EDORA ensures that DPSQA remains compliant with all
          licensing and certification requirements by providing up-to-date
          information and automated alerts regarding regulatory changes. This
          feature enables DPSQA to proactively adapt to new standards, ensuring
          continued excellence in provider oversight.

          Community Services, and Performance & Engagement, benefits immensely
          from EDORA’s integrated communication capabilities. By fostering
          collaboration among these units, EDORA ensures that all aspects of
          provider services are aligned, promoting a cohesive approach to
          quality assurance and improvement.
