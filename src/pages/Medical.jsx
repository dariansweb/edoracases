            <h1>Division of Medical Services</h1>
            <p>
                The Division of Medical Services is the administrative arm of Arkansas Medicaid, overseeing provider enrollment, billing, pharmacy, beneficiary support, and fee-for-service and managed care programs funded by Medicaid. Arkansas Medicaid, which is jointly funded and operated by DHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), provides medically necessary health care services for eligible Arkansans from birth through end-of-life. Beneficiaries with questions about eligibility should contact the Division of County Operations.
            </p>
            <h2>Division Structure</h2>
            <p>The Division is divided into four units:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Plan Partnerships</strong> oversees contract and managed care programs, including the Provider-Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity (PASSE) for Medicaid clients with complex behavioral health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, Non-Emergency Transportation services, the dental managed care program called Health Smiles, and the Arkansas Independent Assessment system that is used to perform a functional-needs assessment to assist in the development of an individualâ€™s Person-Centered Service Plan (PCSP) and personal care services plan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fee for Service</strong> oversees provider enrollment, prior authorizations and utilization review, the Electronic Visit Verification system, rate reviews, the voluntary performance-based incentive program known as Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) program in which physicians agree to monitor the care of their Medicaid clients, and the policy analysis unit, which plans, develops, and implements policy changes within Medicaid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Administration & Operations</strong> oversees contracts, reporting, and technology systems and works with the DHS shared services offices, including Human resources and Finance.
