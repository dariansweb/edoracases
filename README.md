## 🏢 Event-Driven Operations: A New Paradigm in Public Service

#### **Definition:**
Event-Driven Operations (EDO) is a methodology that empowers governmental agencies to streamline and enhance service delivery by responding proactively to key events or triggers. These events, whether client interactions or system-level occurrences, are the driving force behind operational decisions. EDO ensures that every action taken is informed, efficient, and purpose-driven.

Events that may prompt action include:
- **Service Requests** (e.g., a new client inquiry or update)
- **Status Changes** (e.g., changes in client eligibility)
- **Service Expirations** (e.g., end of a placement or program)
- **Urgent Needs** (e.g., health emergencies, crisis intervention)

By focusing on these triggers, **EDORA** creates a responsive, adaptive, and efficient system that works in tandem with agency operations to improve outcomes.
